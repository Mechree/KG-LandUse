# Narrative

The United States Department of Agriculture(USDA), local farmers, and the United Nations have expressed an interest in maximizing efficient land use for future farm and renewable energy developments. However, finding suitable land for these projects can be arduous and depends on many factors, such as soil quality, terrain, pollution, and other factors that influence crop growth or energy efficiency. This project is intended to provide a tool to query the relevant aggregated data to support the exploration and identification of quality land for agriculture and renewable energy use. The primary users of this tool would be local farmers, government entities, and scientific researchers.

Unfortunately, the data that should be used for determining the ideal location for these future land use projects are dispersed among many different entities, require specialized tools to navigate through, or may be difficult to understand without a background in a specific field of study. By implementing a knowledge graph, the appropriate relationships between the available data can be easily identified and used to generate a dataset, which will aid users in identifying the most appropriate locations for their future land development projects. Optimizing this process for users will generate many benefits, including enhanced food security, economic growth, and increased access to reusable energy, which are goals that align with both local and global communities in creating a more sustainable future.

The focus of KG-LandUse will be on the relevant data for the state of Ohio, as it is where the university funding this research resides. However, the schema for this knowledge graph can likely be reused to determine the best land use for any geographic location.

# Competency Questions

1. What are the geographic coordinates for the most highly rated soil quality for croplands within Ohio?
2. What is the availability of sunlight and shading on [geographic location] throughout the year?
3. Which crops are best suited for [soil type]?
4. Does [geographic location] have a low or high risk of flooding?
